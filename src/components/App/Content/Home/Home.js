                    The Rustic Furniture Company featuring<br/>
                    the work of Derek Skapars

                <p>
                    At RNE Furniture, we have coffee tables, dining tables, half-moon tables, 
                    end tables, night stands, walking sticks and much more. We also have a long 
                    list of custom orders we&apos;ve made upon request, which you can view in our 
                    product gallery. Each piece is designed by Derek Skapars himself and carries the 
                    company&apos;s signature spiral, giving each piece a character not found in any 
                    other furniture.

                    We here at Rustic New England Furniture take enormous pride in creating our 
                    products. Custom orders are always welcome and constantly in production and 
                    in-stock items are always being sold or replicated, so we would be happy to show 
                    you or make you something you really like! We even accept PayPal to make owning 
                    a piece of our funiture as easy as possible.
